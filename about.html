            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I am a 2nd year student in the Bachelor of Honours Computer Science (Co-op) program at Conestoga College, specializing in network security. I serve as President of Conestoga College's Cyber Security Student Club (CCSA). Through my academic coursework, hands-on projects, leadership roles, and continuous self-directed learning, I have built a strong technical foundation in software development, data engineering, and offensive/defensive security.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond technical development. I design, develop, and maintain hands-on workshops and events, including Kali Linux tool sessions, Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, Blue Team versus Red Team exercises, and phishing awareness campaigns. These initiatives have helped increase student awareness of malicious emails, SMS messages, suspicious QR codes and harmful links, while strengthening my leadership, communication, and organizational skills.</p>
                
                <p>My academic studies and independent cybersecurity research have strengthened my interest in malware analysis, threat detection, and understanding adversary behavior. I enjoy breaking down complex technical problems, analyzing system and network behavior, and exploring how attacks work in order to better defend against them.</p>
                
                <p>A key part of my technical growth is showcased through my work in the community I work on open-source cybersecurity and software development projects. My work includes web vulnerability scanners, web malware scanners, and network security applications that demonstrate practical experience in threat detection, secure coding practices, and defensive security techniques. I use GitHub as a platform for documentation, testing, experimentation, and iterative improvement.</p>
                
                <p>I am a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science student committed to continuous learning and professional growth. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skills, collaborate with others, and contribute to meaningful projects in cybersecurity and software engineering.</p>
